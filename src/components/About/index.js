                I started my journey a little different than your typical web developer. I was working as a personal trainer, which allowed me to use my college degree
                every day while I helped my clients with their health and wellness goals. I met two clients that were web developers and trained them each for a year. Throughout
                the months of talking to them about life and their careers I discovered that I was not being my best me and I was not pursuing my calling. 
                <br/> 
                My inner child that dreamed every day about taking my imagination and bringing it to life had awoken. I started visiting their home, which was also their workspace, 
                and learning some of the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and though it was challenging initially I knew that I had found something special. 
                <br/>
                A month later in July I enrolled in KU's Full Stack Web Developer Coding Bootcamp and started the daily grind of learning a bunch of new coding languages at a fast pace. 
                Multiple projects later and before I knew it six months had passed and I had learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, React, MySQL, and MongoDB just to name a few languages.
                The possiblities these languages provide were more than I had ever imagined.
                <br/>
                Coding is truly something that has and is still currently changing my life. I love the thrill of thinking about something I want to create whether it is a webpage or 
                an HTML5 based video game. I've discovered my inner child again and am pursuing my dream career. Every time I start writing new code my mind enters a trance and hours will pass
                before I realize that I've been lost in the computer creating. It's truly something I love and will always be a part of my life.
